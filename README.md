# All the Missing SQLite Functions

SQLite has few functions compared to other database management systems. SQLite authors see this as a feature rather than a problem, because SQLite has an extension mechanism in place.

There are a lot of SQLite extensions out there, but they are incomplete, inconsistent and scattered across the internet. `sqlean` brings them together, neatly packaged into domain modules, documented, tested, and built for Linux, Windows and macOS.

We do not try to gather all the existing extensions into one giant pile â€” that would not be very useful. The goal is to create a well-thought set of domain modules with a convenient API. A kind of standard library for SQLite.

To achieve it, we split extensions that are too broad, merge the ones that are too narrow, refactor, add missing features, test, document, and do a ton of other small things.

## Main Set

These are the most popular functions. They are tested, documented and organized into the domain modules with clear API.

Think of them as the extended standard library for SQLite:

-   [crypto](docs/crypto.md): hashing, encoding and decoding data
-   [define](docs/define.md): user-defined functions and dynamic sql
-   [fileio](docs/fileio.md): read and write files
-   [fuzzy](docs/fuzzy.md): fuzzy string matching and phonetics
-   [ipaddr](docs/ipaddr.md): IP address manipulation
-   [json1](docs/json1.md): JSON functions
-   [math](docs/math.md): math functions
-   [regexp](docs/regexp.md): regular expressions
-   [stats](docs/stats.md): math statistics
-   [text](docs/text.md): string functions
-   [unicode](docs/unicode.md): Unicode support
-   [uuid](docs/uuid.md): Universally Unique IDentifiers
-   [vsv](docs/vsv.md): CSV files as virtual tables

## Incubator

These extensions haven't yet made their way to the main set. They may be untested, poorly documented, too broad, too narrow, or without a well-thought API.

[Vote for your favorites](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/issues/27)! We'll refactor and merge popular ones into the main set.

## Download

There are [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/releases/latest) for every OS:

-   `sqlean-win-x64.zip` - for Windows
-   `sqlean-linux-x86.zip` - for Linux
-   `sqlean-macos-x86.zip` - for Intel-based macOS
-   `sqlean-macos-arm64.zip` - for Apple silicon (ARM-based) macOS

Binaries are 64-bit and require a 64-bit SQLite version. If you are using SQLite shell on Windows (`sqlite.exe`), its 64-bit version is available at https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlite.

Incubator extensions are [also available](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/releases/tag/incubator).

## Installation and Usage

Examples below use the `stats` extension; you can specify any other supported extension.

SQLite command-line interface (CLI, aka 'sqlite3.exe' on Windows):

```
sqlite> .load ./stats
sqlite> select median(value) from generate_series(1, 99);
```

IDE, e.g. SQLiteStudio, SQLiteSpy or DBeaver:

```
select load_extension('c:\Users\anton\sqlite\stats.dll');
select median(value) from generate_series(1, 99);
```

Python:

```python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
connection.enable_load_extension(True)
connection.load_extension("./stats")
connection.execute("select median(value) from generate_series(1, 99)")
connection.close()
```

Node.js, using [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3):

```js
const sqlite3 = require("better-sqlite3");
const db = new sqlite3(":memory:");
db.loadExtension("./stats");
db.exec("select median(value) from generate_series(1, 99)");
db.close();
```

## Building from Source

Download the dependencies:

```
make prepare-dist
make download-sqlite
make download-external
```

Then build for your OS (choose one of the following):

```
make compile-linux
make compile-windows
make compile-macos
```

You'll find the compiled extensions in the `dist` folder.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Submit your own or third-party extension to the incubator:

-   [How to submit your extension](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/incubator/docs/submit.md)
-   [How to submit a third-party extension](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/incubator/docs/external.md)

We want every extension to be self-contained. So we limit the project scope to extensions without external dependencies (other than the C standard library and SQLite itself).

Please note that we only accept extensions with permissive licenses (MIT License, Apache License etc) or public domain. Copyleft licenses like GPL won't do.
